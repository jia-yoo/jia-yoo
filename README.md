## Hi there 👋
Hi, I am Jia, a passionate full-stack web Developer with a big heart and an even bigger curiosity. 🌟  

I might not have all the answers yet, but what I lack in experience, I make up for with a passion for learning and a knack for picking things up quickly. 🌱

I believe in the power of asking questions and the magic of learning by doing so. With every error I face and every feature I build, I'm one step closer to becoming a coding wizard. 🧙‍♂️✨

When I'm not coding, I love diving into tech communities, learning about the latest innovations, and dreaming up creative solutions. Let's create something extraordinary! ✨


## Skills and tools

## Outside of coding I enjoy:
Watching LCK 🎮
Baking 🥐
Coffee ☕
Crime and investigative documentaries 🖖

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Check out my projects below, and let's connect!
